# Flashcards
 My solution to Hyperskill's Flashcards project. Utilising ArrayList, HashMap, loops and data validation.
 
With this project, we explore some topics around Java Collections. It's intention is to create "Flashcards" to help create and practice certain information pairs: could be for learning a language, or for memorising countries' capitals etc. It has the ability to import an existing text file that contains information that can be parsed to the programme, as well as exporting to a text file after creating it. It was a good practice for things like loops, ArrayList, HashMap, Scanner, loops, and FileWriter
